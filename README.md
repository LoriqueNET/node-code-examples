# NodeJS Code Examples

This repository contains working code examples for NodeJS, described in posts made on my [website](https://www.lorique.net) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@lorique) . What follows is an installation guide and links to examples.

## Prototyping example
In this example prototyping is showcased using filecaching as an example. We want the methods for setting and getting cache on our API, but we also want to implement TTL for file cache.

Mixins or base classing can be used for the same purpose, but every once in a while you run into issues with both those approaches, and here prototyping is my goto.
